          <p>Hi I'm Alex. I'm the founder of ASSA and very excited to be part of the whole mission to Mars. I've been a deep geek since primary school, I loved learning about the solar system and basically just how the world works. This didn't make me very popular at school, being born and bred in a small country town in the middle of the desert, loving science was not cool. I never really understood why the other kids didn't love astronomy though, we have some of the best stars in Australia. Our sky is big and open and mostly cloudless, I wish more people would come visit us to check it out.
          I studied Aerospace Engineering in Melbourne but moved back to the outback to set up ASSA because we have a long history of space science out here. It's great to be surrounded by aerospace history.
          I can't wait to get to Mars! But we have a lot of work to do before then, I really hope you like our story!</p>

            <p>Hey, I'm Sandy. I came out to Australia after ASSA opened, I've always wanted to come down under and here I am! People in America had given up on going to Mars, it wasn't "financially viable"*. But the team here at ASSA are so enthusiastic and have some great ideas, they're wonderful to work with!
      I'm a rocket scientist through and though. I love space, rockets and big explosions. I love Maths and Engineering and although I really enjoyed studying them at school, I love working with them more. It's so cool to actually make stuff happen!
      In America working in the space industry was considered awesome and cool people loved talking to me and buying me coffee so they could hear stories about life in space. But here in Australia people treat me a bit differently. I don't think they like having an American come here and tell them what to do. I really like Australia though, it's a beautiful country, and even though I'm stuck out here in the desert... well, it's amazing. The coffee is brilliant and the night sky is stunning!
      I can't wait to help get the Aussie team up to Mars!</p>

            <p>Hey team! I'm Jeremy. I answered an ad online asking for people who might want to go to space with ASSA. I think if you look around this website enough you might find a copy of the ad, I think it'll end up being part of history to be honest!
I'm a city kid, I lived, studied and worked in Melbourne my whole life. I was pretty scared about coming out to Woomera. It's a long long way away from anything, and to be honest I'd never actually heard of the town before. But here I am! I took a risk and it was more than worth it, it's dry and flat, but such an amazing place full of history. So many rockets have been launched here over the years, it's inspiring.
I'm a scientist and an adventurer, I love exploring, understanding the world better and going to difficult places. I love space science and understanding how all the planets move, it involves a LOT of maths, but it's amazing to think that it's my calculations that will allow us to get to Mars safely!</p>
