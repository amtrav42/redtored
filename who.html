      <p>Hi, I'm Sandy. I came out to Australia after ASSA opened, I've always wanted to come down under and here I am! People in America had given up on going to Mars, it wasn't "financially viable"*. But the team here at ASSA are so enthusiastic and have some great ideas, they're wonderful to work with!
I'm a rocket scientist through and though. I love space, rockets and big explosions. I love Maths and Engineering and although I really enjoyed studying them at school, I love working with them more. It's so cool to actually make stuff happen!
In America working in the space industry was considered awesome and cool people loved talking to me and buying me coffee so they could hear stories about life in space. But here in Australia people treat me a bit differently. I don't think they like having an American come here and tell them what to do. I really like Australia though, it's a beautiful country, and even though I'm stuck out here in the desert... well, it's amazing. The coffee is brilliant and the night sky is stunning!
I can't wait to help get the Aussie team up to Mars!
