        <p>Once upon a time. Not so very long ago. NASA was having some problems. It was complicated and political. NASA hadn't sent any people to space for a very long time, just robots and satellites. The public was bored and missed having cool astronauts. The President couldn't see the point in a space agency that didn't send people to space to put flags everywhere. So the government decided to sell everything off. NASA, the rockets, the launch pads everything.<br>

          The government was more interested in building bridges and digging up national parks, and putting up lots and lots of American flags. They didn't want to do science. Science was boring according to the government (they were wrong!). Science was never going to be fun they thought. <br>

          So the government decided to sell everything, something called "cost recovery"*. and caused a lot of heartbreak in NASA and across the world. So many people were relying on NASA to get people to Mars, to see a footprint in the red dust on the red planet. But they weren't going to get that anymore. Their dream was dying and so many people were sad. <br>
          It was not a good time to be a space scientist in America. Sandy was just one of the many people to lose their job.

          Legally it turned out that they weren't allowed to sell the equipment in America or to any American companies. So they looked around the world. Where were they going to sell their stuff? They didn't want to sell it to anyone who might actually do anything with it, So they chose a country with a long history of helping with space exploration, with no experience at all in running their own space missions. They thought they chose a country which couldn't launch it's own mission to Mars. <br> They put it all on a big boat and sent it across the pacific, all the way to Australia.
          Now they had a shipping container full of space gear and no one to take it. The Australian government wasn't interested, it was much too expensive.
          So they put an ad on Gumtree, they couldn't afford to advertise anywhere else. The whole event was getting too expensive and too embarrassing. </p>
          <p>And that is where the rest of our team comes in. Alex saw the ad, and from there ASSA was born!</p>
