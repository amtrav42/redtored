        <p>Hey Team, welcome to the start of the Red to Red story. This is Alex writing, the cause of this whole adventure.</p>
        <p>Back in 2015 I was really bored. Like really bored at Uni. I was sick of homework and assignments and being told what to do. So I spent too much time on Gumtree</p>
        <p>So I was looking around for some cool furniture I could buy, and stumbled on an ad. It seemed a bit unreal, too good to be true. But it was all very real!
        I thought you might be interested in what's happened since then.</p>
