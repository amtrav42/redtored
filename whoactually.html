      <h1>Who are you REALLY?</h1>
      <div class="paraoffset">
        <p>Red to Red was a story created for a highschool writing assignment in the mid 2000's.
          It bears no links to any other Mars missions, Mars exploration companies or anything similar.
          It's purely mid 2000's fiction. I got overly into the story, as I have habit to do, and wrote what back then was
          masses of words in a fairly complicated plot about an Australian mission to Mars.
          Back then I saw this as being a real life thing by about 2010. I actually thought by 2010 we would be heading to Mars.
          I was wrong. I am slightly disappointed about this, but knowing what I know now,
          I'm also not convinced that Mars is the best place for us to go next.
        </p>
          <p>I've learned a lot more about Mars, space travel and the challenges.
          As have plenty of other people who've aspired to put their boots down on a dusty Martian surface.
          The whole landscape around missions to space has changed hugely in that time.
          To the point where what I saw as purely government kind of project is now privatised and crowdfunded.
          The young version of me would have been very perplexed about individuals being rich enough to launch their own
          space exploration businesses.
          For now Red to Red is a story about being an Australian who is interested in exploration and space.
          About asking questions, setbacks and the value of being curious.
          It's a story and a platform in development and questions, comments and concerns are incredibly welcome!
